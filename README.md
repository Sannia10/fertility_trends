A short analysis on how fertility trends have changed overtime using Power BI

I've made this super simple dashboard using The World Bank's data which shows the fertility rates across the world overtime. It is interesting to note that there was a sharp decline in average births per woman in the 90's but it has been steadily decreasing for the past 20 years.
Another interesting observation is how the upper middle income countries have drastically reduced their birth rates overtime whereas the gap between the low income countries and high income countries is the highest. This disparity could be explained by lack of educational access across regions. African countries seem to have the highest average birth rates as compared to Europe which has the lowest average.
I was also interested in analysing how Pakistan compares to the other South-Asian countries. Seems like it has the second highest birth rate across the region!
